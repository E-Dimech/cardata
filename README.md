I worked off the inspiration of the two provided mockups to recreate both static web pages. I did my best to match the colour/font/icons throughout and borrowed a photo from google for the login page background. The two pages are zipped together in one file and you should be able to run both separately. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks,

Eric
